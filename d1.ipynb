All companies face demand curves. Whether you are a nine-year-old selling lemonade in the front yard, or GM selling Cadillacs in Shanghai, you have customers and those customers will buy a certain number of items based on the price you charge. If you lower the price, you will sell more. If you raise the price you will sell less. \n\nThis simple fact is called the law of demand.\n\nNote, that our demand curve has quantity on the vertical axis and price on the horizontal access. This is common in most graduate-level economics text books. Undergraduate level text books are usually the opposite (price is on the vertical axis). I know that doesn't make any sense, but we'll save a discussion for why this is the case for another day.\n\nLet's look specifically at the demand curve we just drew. Based on the relationship between price and quantity, if the firm charges one dollar it will sell 100 units. At a price of 10 dollars, it will sell 10 units and at a price of 6 dollars it will sell 50 units.\n\nOf course, there are a bunch of other options. You can easily see them in a demand schedule. This is just the data underlying a demand curve. Let's take a look at our schedule. \n\nAgain, a demand schedule is just a list detailing the number of units you can sell at different prices.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "d = {'price': [1,2,3,4,5,6,6.5,7,8,9,10], 'quantity': [100,90,80,70,60,50,45,40,30,20,10]}\ndf_demand_schedule= pd.DataFrame(data=d)\n\ndf_demand_schedule", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Price elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.

For example, on the curve above the price elasticity of demand when price is 2 dollars differs from the price elasticity of demand when the price is 8 dollars. I will show this graphically in just a second.\n\nNote that there is also something called a constant elasticity demand curve where elasticity is constant and doesn't change from point to point.
